What follows is a quick rules summary along with notes on notation. The board is shown here with a sample random initial setup:

<p>
Columns are labeled with letters A-I and within each column the intersections
are numbered consecutively from 1 to the number of intersections in that
column. Intersections are denoted by a letter and number (e.g., "a1").
</p>
<p> 
Initially, each intersection contains a random marker with colors one of:
(Ivory, Blue, Red, Green, blacK, or Joker) abbreviated by the capitalized
letter. There are eight pieces for each of the five main colors as well as
three joker pieces (in the physical set, jokers are white with black
dots). Jokers have special rules described below.
</p>
<p>
A move consists of moving a stack from one intersection to another, e.g., b1-b2
moves the stack at b1 to top of the stack at b2.  Optionally, one can claim one
of the five main colors before making a move; R,b1-b2 claims the color red
before making the same stacks.  A player can claim up to two colors in the
course of the game with the result that at least one color will always remain
unclaimed/neutral.
</p>
<p>
The resultant stack must not repeat colors and in the normal game once a stack
reaches a height of five (one of each main color), it is removed from the board
if the top marker has a color claimed by the current player.  The goal of the
game is to accumulate stacks of oneâ€™s color.
</p>
<p>
Stacks are moved as a unit and can only be moved to an already occupied
intersection within a straight line (the "Lyngk rule" described below provides
an exception to this rule).  If there is empty space next to a stack it can
move until it hits an occupied intersection.  Jokers in a stack can stand in
for any of the five main colors. A stack can have more than one joker each of
which is then assumed to represent a missing color up to a limit of five
markers.  A stack consisting of a single joker cannot be moved.
</p>
<p>
There are additional restrictions depending on whether the top marker of a
stack has been claimed by the current player, the opponent or is neutral.  A
player cannot move a stack topped by a marker of a color claimed by their
opponent. If a stack being moved is headed by a neutral marker, the stack must
be moved onto a stack of height less than or equal to the height of the stack
being moved.  If a stack is headed by a marker of a color you have claimed, the
height restrictions do not apply: a stack can be moved onto any other stack
provided that the height is five or less and colors are not duplicated.
</p>
<p>
In addition to moving stacks in straight lines, another possibility for a stack
headed by a marker of a color you have claimed is to make
a <strong>lyngk</strong> move. If there is a stack within an unobstructed line
headed by a piece of the same color, you can proceed to any intersection that
could be reached from <em>that</em> stack (bouncing off that intersection) and
this rule can be applied multiple times, i.e., you can make more than one
bounce. In the following board position, assuming that player 1 has claimed the
color blue, they can move the stack from <strong>b4</strong>
to <strong>e2</strong> via blue stacks at <strong>b1</strong>
and <strong>c3</strong>.

       <strong>BJ</strong>      -       I       B            
           K       <strong>KI</strong>      R            
               R       -                    
           I       B       I            

   A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I

</pre>
<p>
If a player finds that they cannot make any legal move, they are forced to
pass. Note that if a player has not claimed both of their colors, and by
claiming a color they would be able to move, they must do so; voluntary passing
is not allowed. If neither player can move, the game is over and the winner is
the player who has removed the most stacks of five. If both players have the
same number of stacks of five, the player who has the most stacks of four
headed by markers of colors they have claimed and if that is still tied, stacks
of three, etc. If this procedure does not break the tie, the game is a draw.
</p>
<p>
In <strong>stack6</strong> mode, additional rules are added.  Stacks of height
five are not removed from the board.  Players are allowed to make a stack of
six provided the stack contains at least one joker.  That joker is considered
to represent a sixth color (note the stack could have other jokers taking the
place of any of the other five colors).  A player who forms a stack of six with
one of his markers on top wins immediately.  A stack of six with a neutral
piece on top does not end the game.  Otherwise, the game proceeds as normal.

Lyngk is the seventh game in Kris Burm's Project Gipf and the inventor
describes it as an umbrella containing elements of all the previous games.  It
has been adapted for Richard's PBEM server by Lyman Hurd.
