here with a sample random initial setup:

<p>
A move consists of moving the contents of a stack at one intersection to
another and optionally claiming an available color,
e.g., <strong>b1-b2</strong> moving a stack from b1 to b2 (assuming both source
and destination intersections are occupied) or <strong>R,b1-b2</strong> which
claims the color red before making the same move.
</p>
<p>
The letters mark columns and the numbers indicate rows.  Intersections are
denoted by a letter and number (e.g., "a1").  Each intersection contains a
stack of markers with colors: (Ivory, Blue, Red, Green, blacK, Joker)
abbreviated by the capitalized letter.  There are eight markers of the five
main colors and three jokers (in the physical set, jokers are white with black
dots).  Jokers have special rules outlined below.
</p>
<p>
Stacks are moved as a unit and a stack can only be moved to an already occupied
intersection within a straight line for which the intervening intersections are
blank (the "Lyngk rule" described below provides an exception to this rule).
The resultant stack must have no repeating colors and must be of height less
than or equal to five.  A Joker cannot be moved independently and in a stack it
can stand in for any of the five main colors.  A stack can have more than
one joker which are then assumed to represent two missing colors.
</p>
<p>
In the course of the game, players have the option of claiming one of the five
main colors as long as it has not been claimed by their opponent up to a
maximum of two claimed colors per player (i.e., the game will always have at
least one neutral color).  Claiming a color can be done any time during the
game and often it makes sense to wait to claim a color until it is
strategically advantageous.
</p>
<p>
You cannot move a stack headed by a marker of a color claimed by one's
opponent.  If the stack being moved is headed by a neutral marker, the stack
must be moved onto a stack of height less than or equal to the height of the
stack being moved.  A stack headed by a joker (which must be of height one)
cannot be moved.
</p>
<p>
If a stack is headed by a marker of a color you control, the height
restrictions no longer apply, i.e., a stack of height one could be moved onto a
stack of height four, however the rule that colors cannot be duplicated
remains.
</p>
<p>
Another possibility for a stack you control is to make a <strong>lyngk</strong>
move.  In this case, you can not only choose as a destination an intersection
within a straight line, but also if there is a stack within an unobstructed
line headed by a piece of the same color, you can proceed to any intersection
that could be reached from that stack (bouncing off that intersection) and this
rule can be applied recursively, i.e., you can make more than one bounce.  In
the following board position, assuming that player 1 controls, blue, they can
move the stack from b4 to e2 because there are blue stacks at b1 and c3.

</pre>
<p>
If a player cannot move, they are forced to pass.  Note that if a player has
not claimed both of their colors, and by claiming a color they would be able to
move, they must do so; voluntary passing is not allowed.  If neither player can
move, the game is over and the winner is the player who has removed the most
stacks of five.  If both player has the same number of stacks of five, the
player who has the most stacks of four under their control and if that is still
tied, stacks of three, etc.  If this procedure does not break the tie, the game
is a draw.
</p>
<p>
In <strong>stack6</strong> mode, additional rules are added.  Stacks of height
five are not removed from the board.  Players are allowed to make a stack of
six provided the stack contains at least one joker.  That joker is considered
to represent a sixth color (note the stack could have other jokers taking the
place of any of the other five colors).  A player who forms a stack of six with
one of his markers on top wins immediately.  A stack of six with a neutral
piece on top does not end the game.  Otherwise, the game proceeds as normal.

<h2>References and History</h2>
<p>
Lyngk is the seventh game in Kris Burm's Project Gipf and the inventor
describes it as an umbrella containing elements of all the previous games.  It
has been adapted for Richard's PBEM server by Lyman Hurd.
